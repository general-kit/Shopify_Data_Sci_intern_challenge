a.
The issue with the data set appears to be abnormally high unit costs as well as abnormally high orders from some shops


b. What metric will you use?
One metric I can use is the average order value, after excluding all the “erroneous” data
This gives a more accurate depiction of the Average order value from the customers.

Another Metric that can be used is the modal value of the order amount, assuming that the data in the system is correct.
This value also happens to be the same regardless of the data, in this case, it works because the outliers
are not the majority


c. What is it’s value?

This new AOV (with the corrected data set) will be:
303.0 (rounded up to the nearest whole number)

If we stuck with the original data, the modal value will be:
153.0


With these values, it gives a fair idea of the shops growth
